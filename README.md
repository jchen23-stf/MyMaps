# MyMaps
An Android app demonstrating how to use the Google Maps API. See the YouTube playlist to learn how to build this.

This app displays a map showing markers of important places. You can also create a map which gets saved to a file and can be retrieved when the app is opened.

This app helps you keep track of places that matter to you, whether they’re vacation ideas or places you’ve lived. It's a simpler version of this app the My Maps app by Google.

** this is currently a bug in the code that prevents the code from compiling - I am in the process of fixing it
